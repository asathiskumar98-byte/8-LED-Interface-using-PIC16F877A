# 8-LED-Interface-using-PIC16F877A

🧭 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control 8 LEDs simultaneously using PORTB of the PIC16F877A microcontroller.
All 8 LEDs are turned ON for 1 second and then OFF for 1 second — a simple but essential step in learning digital output control.

⚙️ Hardware & Software Requirements

Hardware:

PIC16F877A Microcontroller

8 LEDs

8 × 330Ω Resistors

Breadboard or Proteus simulation board

Software:

MPLAB X IDE

XC8 Compiler

Proteus 8 Professional (for simulation)

🧩 Proteus Circuit Setup

Controller: PIC16F877A

Oscillator: 20 MHz Crystal (pins 13 & 14)

LED Connections:

Connect RB0–RB7 → each through a 330Ω resistor → to GND

Power Supply: +5V to VDD, GND to VSS

▶️ Simulation Steps

Open Proteus_Design.pdsprj in Proteus 8.

Load the .hex file generated by MPLAB X.

Run the simulation — all LEDs blink ON and OFF together every second.

📸 Output

All 8 LEDs glow ON for 1s, then OFF for 1s, repeating endlessly.

🚀 Future Expansion Ideas

Sequential LED blinking (running light or “Knight Rider” pattern).

Binary counter display on LEDs.

Interactive input using switches or sensors.
